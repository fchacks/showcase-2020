Our website solves the severe problem of the detrimental toll on patients’ mental health during and after their experience in the hospital. This website prototype encompasses a variety of stories, motivational quotes, and jokes, all of which are posted by different “patients”. The website includes a welcome page, which informs the patients about what our website will include. 

The page on survival stories is where patients can talk about their experiences in the hospital so that the readers can relate and feel less alone and more included in the community.

The page for motivation consists of numerous quotes that can help raise one’s spirits and help them stay determined to get well throughout their stay at the hospital.

Another page we included has a number of jokes to brighten the patients’ moods and raise their spirits.
