In my FCHacks project, my code finds the difference between two different bone structures and uses this to see if a patient has a broken bone. The code looks for differences between the two bone images, and if something is different, the code says that the patient has a broken bone. Since doctors are now in less numbers, doctors can use the AI to see if a patient has a broken bone without directly contacting the patient.
