This is a website that helps scientists and researchers find patterns and changes in DNA using Gel electrophoresis and CRISPR  to help cure cancers. This website informs the user about what this technology is and prompts the user questions based on their scientific and interest in the topic itself. It will then send the user to different pages based on the options they chose above. One includes a link in which users can read a little more information about this upcoming technology. Finally, the user is sent to a last page in which a work in progress prototype identifies an image and alerts the user about patterns it recognizes. 1 individual(Prajval Sreenivas) a novice coder who did this project worked in HTML, JSS, and C++ using the Repl.it software.


Minor Note to the Judges, FCHacks mentors, moderators, sponsors, and guest speakers: Thank you so much for giving me and hundreds of other kids an opportunity to be a coder for a weekend. COVID-19 has affected us all, but this virtual hackathon made me feel like we are all in the same room together. Again thanks for being a part of this and I hope to do it next year, but maybe in school.
